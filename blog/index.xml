      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with HES data on a project, and the current structure of tables we have is for each of the different datasets (Inpatients, Outpatients, Emeregency Care, etc.) we have a separate table for each financial year. Within these there will be a column like EPIKEY or ATTENDKEY which is the primary key in that table. This key is stored as a BIGINT.
This key restarts counting each year&amp;hellip; well, sort of.</description>

      <description>GitHub Actions is a super useful way to automate some of the boring tasks that we have to do day in, day out. And the wonderful r-lib have created a bunch of actions for R that will make your life super easy. Along with the {usethis} package, and the function usethis::use_github_action(), you can easily set up a bunch of predefined actions.
Below is an example of an action that I created for my talks repository recently.</description>
