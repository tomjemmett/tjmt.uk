For the [2021 NHS-R conference][nhsr21] I delivered a workshop on functional programming ([slides][fp_slides],
[video][fp_video]) and a lightning talk on Object Orientated Programming in R using S3 ([slides][oop_slides],
[video][oop_video]).

I also had the pleasure of helping out in two other workshops: "Reproducible computation at scale in R with `{targets}`"
by Will Landau and an introduction to "Artificial Neural Networks in R with Keras and TensorFlow" by Leon Eyrich Jessen.
Both of these sessions were fantastically informative and delivered expertly.

This is the 4^th^ NHS-R conference, and I have been lucky enough to attend all of them. Each year they get bigger and
better, as can be seen by the incredible line up of speakers from this year (including stars like Prof. Frank Harrell
and Julia Silge). I can't wait for next years conference!
